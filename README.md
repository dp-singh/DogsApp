## About

Sample project that build with MVVM clean architecture 
Unit tests are written with JUnit4, MockK, Truth, MockWebServer. Data, Domain, and ViewModel tests.

## Overview
* Gradle Kotlin DSL is used for setting up gradle files with `buildSrc` folder and extensions.
* Data module uses Retrofit and Room to provide Local and Remote data sources
